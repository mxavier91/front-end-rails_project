 <h1>Calling All CINEPHILES!!!</h1>



<h2>A Movie Storage App</h2>

"Calling All CINEPHILES" is my first attemped at creating a Full-Stack App. My reasoning for making this is because I watch alot of movies, and with all the ways to watch movies nowadays, I thought it would great to have a place that you can store these movies. This way when you are with your friends or family, you can log into the app and let them know what movies you've seen. The app allows users to not only store movies, but they can also update entries, Change their Password, and even delete unwanted movies as well.

<h2>Things to Add with more Time</h2>
If I had time there would be ALOT of features I want to add.

1. I wanted to make "Calling All CINEPHILES" more of a community based app. Therefore I would love to add a feature that would allow users to see other users movie collection
2. On top of that, I would also want to add the ability for users to leave a Description of their movie, or even a review.
3. The last feature I would add would allow people who aren't signed in to see other people's movie collection. This feature would allow people to checkout what other people thought about a certain movie. The user that isn't signed in would be able to see people's movies, but they won't be to delete, update or change the password of any user that already has an account.
