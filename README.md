# front-end-rails_project

First Day Working on Front End

Once I was done with the back end coding, I went straight to the front end. I was a little worried on how I would tackle this end of the project, but after thinking about for a little while, I realized that it was similar to other projects I worked on in the past. The first thing I wanted to do was test the curl scripts. First I tested them by inputting the params into the terminal. I completed both the Authorization and the CRUD in the terminal and was successful. Once I was finished with that I created buttons in order to test my CURL scripts on the web app. I didn't think about CSS in anyway, the only thing I wanted to do was focus on test the CURL script on the web app.

Day 2 Working on Front End

I saw that a few of my classmates were using bootstrap to display their web app, but I decided to just use standard HTML. Once I created to buttons, I created files to hold my ui, my api, and my events. Alot of my code was very similar to my last project which as Tic Tac Toe. Throughout the front end I used Javascript and Jquery to give my page functionality. In order to have my back end connect with my front end I used the URL from my deployed herokuapp and used that for my Authorization and CRUD CURL scripts.
